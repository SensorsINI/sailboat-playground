# PowerShell Terminal Prompt Recognition

## Command Completion Patterns

When working with terminal output, recognize these PowerShell prompt patterns as indicators of command completion:

### Standard PowerShell Prompts
- `PS C:\path\to\directory>` - Standard PowerShell prompt
- `PS F:\path\to\directory>` - PowerShell prompt on different drive
- `PS .*>` - General pattern for PowerShell prompts (regex)

### Command Completion Indicators

**Completed Commands**: When you see output ending with a PowerShell prompt after a significant delay (>2 seconds), this indicates:
1. The previous command has finished executing
2. The shell is ready for new input
3. Any partial output shown represents the complete command result

**Interrupted Commands**: When you see patterns like:
```
PS F:\path> command
PS F:\path> q^C
```
This indicates:
- The command was interrupted with Ctrl+C
- The `^C` represents the interrupt signal
- The command did not complete successfully

### Terminal Behavior Guidelines

1. **Wait for Prompts**: Always wait for the PowerShell prompt to appear before assuming a command is complete
2. **Recognize Delays**: Significant delays before prompt appearance usually indicate command processing time
3. **Handle Interruptions**: Commands ending with `^C` should be considered incomplete/failed
4. **Path Interpretation**: The path in the prompt shows the current working directory

### Common PowerShell Command Patterns

- **Git Commands**: Often show progress indicators before returning to prompt
- **Package Installation**: May show download progress and installation steps
- **File Operations**: Large file operations may have delays before prompt return
- **Network Operations**: Commands involving network requests often have variable delays

### Pager Handling

Many commands use pagers by default which can cause incomplete output or hanging commands. Always use non-interactive options:

**Git Commands with Pager Prevention**:
- `git log --oneline --no-pager` or `git --no-pager log --oneline`
- `git diff --no-pager` or `git --no-pager diff`
- `git show --no-pager` or `git --no-pager show`
- `git status --no-pager` (though status rarely needs it)

**Alternative Approach**: Pipe to `cat` to prevent pager activation:
- `git log | cat`
- `git diff | cat`
- `command-with-pager | cat`

**Configure Git Globally** (recommended):
```bash
git config --global pager.diff false
git config --global pager.show false
git config --global pager.log false
```

**Signs of Pager Issues**:
- Command appears to hang without returning to prompt
- Partial output that seems cut off
- Commands that would normally show long output but show nothing

### Error Recognition

PowerShell errors typically appear before the prompt returns:
```
PS F:\path> some-command
Error: Command failed
PS F:\path>
```

The presence of the prompt after error messages indicates the command has completed (albeit with errors).
